            <h2>Solution for submarine pilots</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Due to low visibility, the Pilot faces trouble, so the submarine can have implemented
                SONAR(slightly harmful), Radar, and Night Vision. For unpredictable currents, leaks,
                high pressure, we could make the body of the submarine (heavy steel device) thicker
                using Titanium Alloy (Strong yet light material). Technical issues could happen at any
                time, so much precaution could not be taken, yet we could make sure the wires and
                electric devices are properly insulated and waterproofed. Now due to confined space,
                we could make the body slimmer and make the front side into a streamlined body to
                help, in speed. This submarine should have an imaging system to help capture pictures
                of the ocean for mapping. By adding Manipulator arms the pilot can perfom collection
                of samples, construction and valve turns.</p>

            <h2>Some specs about the submarine</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>This submarine, is a fast beast with 6 engines that can propell the full on
                    submarine erally fast</li>
                <li>In addition to the aerodynamic body there are built in robotic arms to perform
                    underwater missions</li>
                <li>There is also a built in antenna for remote controling</li>
                <li>With the help of slim body you can explore deep sea</li>
                <li>To navigate you get built in SONAR(not reccomended to use at all times, radar
                    as a back-up and nigh-vision </li>
                <li>With th help of Titanium alloyâ€™s strength and light weight,we can make the
                    submarine light, and prevent leaks and compression </li>
                <li>Has built in all-time recording cameras which can help see in well-light areas of
                    the sea.</li>

            <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
            <h5>Did you know that all submarine pilots go as deep as only 200m(656ft) - 500m(1640).
                The submarine i have built can go upto 4000m(13,123ft)</h5>

            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <h5>My inspiration for the Submarine was that as a child, I had
                inspiration and passion for vehicle and tech knowledge. The above
                submarine was built by me with inspiration from concorde.
                Concorde is a retired Anglo-French supersonic airliner jointly
                developed and manufactured by Sud Aviation, which was built to
                travel in high speeds(Mach 2) to transport passengers in high speeds</h5>
